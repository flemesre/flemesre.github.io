## Hello.

I am a ML/software engineeer at Huron Digital Pathology, in St. Jacobs, Ontario. I mostly work on computer vision problems in the field of digital pathology. Previously, I completed a BSc in Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo.

I will be posting things and projects that I am working on or find interesting here from time to time.

My LinedIn profile can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fglemesre/).
